This final report on the performance of UVA men's basketball is intended for the Coaching Staff, as well as the Athletic Department. These stakeholders are involved in studying and making decisions about player developments, training loads, game preparations, and long-term performance strategies.


In today’s college basketball climate where players often jump from school to school, many programs have struggled to adapt. Many programs, like UVA, have historically relied on player development with the convention of players staying at a single school throughout their college career. Given the shifting landscape, we want to analyze whether or not a single season is enough for a player to truly develop and progress. We will look at the Catapult data of several players over the course of a season, tracking how their PlayerLoad/min and jump/acceleration band distributions evolve. We want to measure individual growth with the aim of driving scouting decisions. Should coaches scout players with the anticipation that significant player development can happen over the course of just one season or should they recruit more talented players with less room for growth under the assumption that one season isn’t enough for a player to mature?
